      <p>Thank you for visiting <strong>StellarTool</strong> (<a href="https://stellartool1502.github.io/StellarTool/">https://stellartool1502.github.io/StellarTool/</a>) — a free collection of browser-based utility tools ("Site", "we", "us", or "our"). Your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how we share it, and the choices you have.</p>

      <h2>1. What this policy covers</h2>
      <p>This policy applies to information collected through the Site and any services, features, or tools provided on the Site. It does not apply to third-party websites, services, or developer tools that you may reach via links from our Site.</p>

      <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
      <p>We collect two types of information:</p>

      <h3>a) Information you provide directly</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contact information</strong>: If you contact us (for example using a contact form or via email) you may provide your name and email address and any message content.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional feedback or account details</strong>: If we ever add account features in the future, any profile information you choose to provide.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Most tools on StellarTool are client-side (run in your browser) and do not require registration. In many cases, data you input into a tool is processed locally in your browser and is not sent to our servers.
      </div>

      <h3>b) Automatically collected information</h3>
      <p>When you visit the Site we may automatically collect certain technical and usage information, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Device & browser information</strong> (device type, operating system, browser type and version)</li>
        <li><strong>IP address and approximate location</strong> (city/region level)</li>
        <li><strong>Usage data</strong> (pages visited, time on page, clicks, tool usage)</li>
        <li><strong>Referral and traffic source</strong> (how you reached the Site)</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies</strong> (see Section 6)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We use this information to monitor and improve the Site, fix bugs, and for security.</p>

      <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
      <p>We use information for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>To operate and maintain the Site</strong> (serve pages, run the tools, perform diagnostics)</li>
        <li><strong>To respond to your messages or requests</strong> if you contact us</li>
        <li><strong>To analyze and improve the Site</strong> — performance, popular tools, and user experience</li>
        <li><strong>Security and fraud prevention</strong> (detecting and preventing abuse)</li>
        <li><strong>Legal compliance</strong> when required by law</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will only use personal information for purposes compatible with the purpose for which it was collected unless we first obtain your consent.</p>

      <h2>4. Sharing and disclosure</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>
      <p>We may share data in the following limited circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers</strong>: We may share information with trusted third-party service providers who help run the Site (e.g., hosting, analytics, email providers). These providers are contractually bound to use the data only for the services they perform for us.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal and safety reasons</strong>: If required by law, court order, or to respond to legal process; to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Site, our users, or others.</li>
        <li><strong>Business transfers</strong>: If we reorganize, merge, or sell the Site (or part of it), user data may be transferred as part of that transaction; we will notify users where required by law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Third-party services and links</h2>
      <p>The Site may use third-party services that collect information about your use of the Site (for example analytics). Common third parties include Google Analytics, GitHub Pages (hosting), and other widely used providers. These third parties have their own privacy policies — we recommend you review them.</p>
      <p>The Site may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites.</p>

      <h2>6. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
      <p>We may use cookies, local storage, and other technologies to collect and store information about your visit. Cookies help with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Remembering technical preferences (e.g., mobile/desktop behavior)</li>
        <li>Analytics and usage metrics</li>
        <li>Security (rate-limiting or abuse protection)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can control or delete cookies through your browser settings. Note that blocking cookies may affect Site functionality.</p>

      <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
      <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or as required by law. Automatically collected analytics data may be retained in aggregated or anonymized form for longer periods to improve the Site.</p>

      <h2>8. Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet transmission or storage system is completely secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

      <h2>9. Children</h2>
      <p>The Site is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, contact us and we will take steps to delete it.</p>

      <h2>10. International transfers</h2>
      <p>The Site is hosted using third-party services that may store and process data in different countries. By using the Site, you consent to transfer of information to countries outside your jurisdiction, which may have different data protection laws.</p>

      <h2>11. Your rights (GDPR, CCPA and similar rights)</h2>
      <p>Depending on where you live, you may have rights regarding your personal data, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The right to access</li>
        <li>The right to correct inaccurate data</li>
        <li>The right to request deletion (right to be forgotten)</li>
        <li>The right to object to or restrict processing</li>
        <li>The right to data portability</li>
        <li>Under some laws (for example CCPA), the right to opt out of the sale of personal information (we do not sell personal information)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us using the contact details below. We may ask for proof of identity before fulfilling certain requests.</p>

      <h2>12. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the <strong>Effective date</strong> at the top of the policy. Material changes will be posted on the Site.</p>
